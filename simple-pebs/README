# simple standalone reference pebs driver

##
## Note: this is just a reference driver for PEBS on Linux, mainly as a reference
## for writing new experimential drivers and for porting PEBS code to other
## operating systems. See it as a code example.
##
## The code is written in a way that it should be easy to adapt to other OS.
##
## It is not compiling anymore under recent Linux kernels due
## to some API changes (but can be made to work with simple changes)
## Please don't open bugs about it. If you can't fix it SimplePEBS
## is likely not for you.
##
## If you just want to use PEBS on Linux the builtin Linux perf
## support is near always a better choice. All functionality
## supported by simple pebs is supported by Linux perf in a better way.
## You may need a recent enough kernel to support your CPU.

PEBS "Precise Event Based Sampling" is a profiling technology in Intel CPUs,
that uses microcode to do (mostly) precise event samples.

The driver is "free running" and minimizes interrupts, to allow a maximum 
PEBS frequency. Interrupts are only triggered when the PEBS buffer is full.

This will take over the PEBS hardware from perf and may cause conflicts.

To build user tools use "make user"

sample file format:
{8 bytes 	ip}


simple-pebs.c	Linux simple pebs driver
dumper.c	Dump samples running from running Linux driver. -b to write binary sample file
		Most other tools require running dumper first to dump the samples.

samples.c	Decode (ELF symbols) sample from running Linux driver.

gencsv.c	Generate Vtune style CSV format from sample file (not useful).
histogram.c	Generate histogram from sample file

toperf.c	Generate perf.data from sample file
