All instructions older than this one will be allowed to finish.  This instruction and all younger instructions must be cleared, since they must not be allowed to complete.  Essentially, the hardware waits until the problematic instruction is the oldest instruction in the machine.  This means all older instructions are retired, and all pending stores (from older instructions) are completed.  Then the new path of instructions from the front end are allowed to start into the machine.  There are many conditions that might cause a machine clear (including the receipt of an interrupt, or a trap or a fault).

"0xCA","0x50","NO_ALLOC_CYCLES.NOT_DELIVERED","The NO_ALLOC_CYCLES.NOT_DELIVERED event is used to measure front-end inefficiencies, i.e. when front-end of the machine is not delivering micro-ops to the back-end and the back-end is not stalled. This event can be used to identify if the machine is truly front-end bound.  When this event occurs, it is an indication that the front-end of the machine is operating at less than its theoretical peak performance.  Background: We can think of the processor pipeline as being divided into 2 broader parts: Front-end and Back-end. Front-end is responsible for fetching the instruction, decoding into micro-ops (uops) in machine understandable format and putting them into a micro-op queue to be consumed by back end. The back-end then takes these micro-ops, allocates the required resources.  When all resources are ready, micro-ops are executed. If the back-end is not ready to accept micro-ops from the front-end, then we do not want to count these as front-end bottlenecks.  However, whenever we have bottlenecks in the back-end, we will have allocation unit stalls and eventually forcing the front-end to wait until the back-end is ready to receive more UOPS. This event counts the cycles only when back-end is requesting more uops and front-end is not able to provide them. Some examples of conditions that cause front-end efficiencies are: Icache misses, ITLB misses, and decoder restrictions that limit the the front-end bandwidth.","0,1","200003","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"
"0xCA","0x3F","NO_ALLOC_CYCLES.ALL","The NO_ALLOC_CYCLES.ALL event counts the number of cycles when the front-end does not provide any instructions to be allocated for any reason. Note that one can use the NO_ALLOC_CYCLES.ALL event to approximate the number of UOPS that are allocated.  To do this, invert the NO_ALLOC_CYCLES.ALL event to count the number of cycles where UOPS are allocated.  Multiply those cycles by 2, since 2 UOPS are allocated each cycle to obtain an approximation for the number of UOPS allocated. This technique is only approximate since some UOPS must be allocated by themselves when they require certain machine resources (e.g. UOPS that require entries in two different RS structures).

Background: Modern microprocessors employ extensive pipelining and speculative techniques.  Since sometimes an instruction is started but never completed, the notion of retirement is introduced.
